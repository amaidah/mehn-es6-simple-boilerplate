Simple boilerplate for MEHN apps in a full ES6 environment
- Uses only package.json scripts
- Must have xcode, node, npm, sass, rollup, nodemon installed

### Getting Started

- `git clone <repo>`
- `npm install`
- `git remote rm origin`
- `git remote -v` // verify removal
- `git remote add origin <your own>`
- `git remote -v` // verify addition
- change project folder name

Serve production
- `npm run start`

Serve dev server
- `npm run dev`

### Notes

- This is what I use to build mehn apps, pkg json scripts depend on globally installed sass, rollup, nodemon
